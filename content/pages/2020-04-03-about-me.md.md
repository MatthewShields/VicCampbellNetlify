          Originally from the UK, I first moved to Minnesota 6 years ago. After
          a few back and forths between the two countries, I now call
          Minneapolis home. I have built my career out of telling client stories
          through photography. From food & travel to brand and lifestyle
          photography, I'm passionate about the people behind every dish, craft
          or service and take great pride in being able to document the best
          version of that story. I'm drawn to images that aren't perfect - the
          ones that make you look twice or raise a question.
